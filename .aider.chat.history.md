I'll help you commit and push the changes with a proper commit message. Here are the commands to run:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore: Update gitignore with swap files and cache exclusions"
git push
```

This will:
1. Stage all changes
2. Create a commit with a descriptive message
3. Push the changes to your remote repository

The commit message follows best practices by:
1. Using the "chore" prefix to indicate maintenance changes
2. Clearly stating what was updated in gitignore
3. Keeping it concise but descriptive

Let me know if you'd like me to suggest any other improvements!
